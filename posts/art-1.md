In this art exhibit, I graphed two different maps of the United States, showing a changing heat map. The heat map is of how many cases there are in each state. Then the heat map goes from green to red depending on the concentration of the cases. Each image is individually available on [the photos folder](https://github.com/austinmccalley/engr352/tree/master/art1/photos/). I rendered each image twice, once with just the heat map, and then second with the state being outlined in blue when its stay in place effect happened. I was able to gather all the data from the [New York Times COVID-19 GitHub repo](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/) where the data is updated every day. I was then able to find a shapefile of the United States that provided the coordinates of all the borders of each state, which allowed me to "draw" it and then fill in the information with the heat map.
