In this art exhibit, I visualized two different things. The first thing that I visualized was the percentage of each state that was infected with COVID-19. I found the state population from the census bureau then took the number of cases in each state and divided it by the population, giving me a heat map. The heat map is visualized [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinmccalley/engr352/master/art3/photos/map/Animated%20Change.gif)

The second that I visualized was the change in the number of cases per state. Then I graphed a line of best fit for the next 15% of the days that have had numbers. For example, if a state has had data for the past 100 days, I could graph the next 15 days in the future. However, the line of best fit is tough to get correct because we do not have a standard model that demonstrates the data. You can pick which state you want to see the change in the number of cases per state in [this folder](https://github.com/austinmccalley/engr352/tree/master/art3/photos/plots).
