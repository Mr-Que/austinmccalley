In this art exhibit, I graphed a heat map of the United States again using my prior art as a reference. In this one, I graphed the GDP per case in each state. We often hear that the GDP of a place is how healthy the economy is and when we cross that with the amount of COVID-19 cases, we can see how healthy the economy is per state. For example, Oregon has one of the highest GDP per case, meaning that our economy is doing relatively well compared to New York, which has the lowest GDP per case.
