I finally got my updated blog back up and running. With this blog we have some of the same features but it's mostly automated and easier for me to just upload a post file and it takes care of everything else for me. As well, I do not have to pay for a server because this is also hosted online for free. 

I hopefully should get my ENGR 352 blog posts back up on here and also add my portfolio to here as well.
