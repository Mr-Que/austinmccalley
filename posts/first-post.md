I finally got my updated blog back up and running. With this blog, we have some of the same features, but it's mostly automated and more effortless for me to upload a post file, and it takes care of everything else for me. As well, I do not have to pay for a server because this is also hosted online for free. 

Hopefully, I should get my ENGR 352 blog posts back up on here and also add my portfolio here.
