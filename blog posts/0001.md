# Yay! My First Blog!

Hello and welcome to my very first blog post. This website is going to be used for blogging, posting tutorials and reviews as I go through my life as a developer. 

## About me
Now a little bit about me.

I am a first-year college student first-year majoring in computer science and getting a minor in mathematics. 
I plan on pursuing an option in data science where I can hopefully work with mathematical models for different research projects and companies in the future.

I am also an avid programmer, you can find all of my open-source code on my [github](https://www.github.com/austinmccalley/). 
I program mostly in Python and JavaScript; however, I am currently learning C++ for school and hopefully I will start making public C++ code repositories for my code to be available. 
I am also a staff member on the parterned Discord server [Devcord](https://discord.gg/devcord) which specializes in web development but there is also help for everyone in between. 

## Navigating the Site
So a little quick blurb about how to navigate the site. On the home page which you must have gone through is where all my blogs are posted. As well in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, you can screen three categories, ``Blogs``, ``Reviews``, ``Tutorials`` where you can click those and filter by those to see only of that type. (That sentence doesn't make sense.)

## Final Regards
This website is all open source and availablefor you to download and use on your own. You can find it [here](https://github.com/austinmccalley/) on my GitHub. Hopefully, I will add a README by March to be able to successfully use my website as a template for the future.

So long,

Austin | ℚ.
